        <h1>CHINESE LEGEND - THE DRAGON</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">The Chinese dragon, also known as the <b><mark>loong, long or lung </mark></b><i>(simplified Chinese: 龙; traditional Chinese: 龍; pinyin: lóng),</i> is a <b>legendary creature </b> Chinese mythology, Chinese folklore, and Chinese culture at large. <br>Chinese dragons have many animal-like forms such as turtles and fish, but are most commonly depicted as snake-like with four legs.<br>Academicians have identified four reliable theories on the origin of the Chinese dragon: snakes, Chinese alligators, thunder worship and nature worship.<br>They traditionally symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Chinese tradition has always used the dragon totem as the national emblem, and the "Yellow Dragon flag" of the Qing dynasty has influenced the impression that China is a dragon in many European countries. The <mark>white dragon of the flag of modern Bhutan </mark>is a classic Chinese-style dragon.</p>
  
    <h2>SYMBOLIC VALUE</h2>  
<p style="font-size: large;">Historically, the Chinese dragon was associated with the Emperor of China and used as a symbol to represent imperial power. The founder of the Han dynasty Liu Bang claimed that he was conceived after his mother dreamt of a dragon.During the Tang dynasty, Emperors wore robes with dragon motif as an imperial symbol, and high officials might also be presented with dragon robes. In the <b>Yuan dynasty</b>, the two-horned five-clawed dragon was designated for use by the Son of Heaven or Emperor only, while the four-clawed dragon was used by the princes and nobles.Similarly during the <b> Ming and Qing dynasty</b>, the <i>five-clawed dragon </i> strictly reserved for use by the Emperor only. The dragon in the <b>Qing dynasty</b> appeared on the <em>first Chinese national flag</em></p>

<h2>WORSHIP - The Dragon King</h2>
<p style="font-size: large;">Dragon King is deified as a god, called the Dragon God, and it is the highest ruler in seas, controlling all creatures in seas, and a god controlling water and weather
<p  style="font-size: large;"> Noble as a god, the Dragon King is invited into temples, and worshipped by believers. His majestic and unique power makes him the controller of weather and water, and he may let it rains a lot, and he may order no rainfalls, which would in a great sense, have an impact on farming. Dragon Kings live in waters: the four Dragon Kings live in the four seas, and other dragon kings may live in lakes, rivers or other waters. When the dragon king is anger or loses his temper, the waters would be roaring, and have immense rolling waves, which is terrible for sailing and fishery. That makes dragon kings win respects from people and be an important god to people’s living. In temples, you can see dragon elements and sculptures of Dragon King here and there, while some temples enshrine more than one dragon king. In special days and festivals, like the Dragon Heads-raising Day and in the event of a drought, people would go to a Dragon King Temple, light incense sticks and pray for rains and good weather for agricultural production. When peasants suffer severe droughts, the Emperor of imperial authority may make worship rituals to Dragon King and devoutly pray for rains. In the Qing dynasty, the rituals are usually made in the Temple of Heaven.</p>

        In Chinese legend, the Dragon Kings were believed to be the rulers of weather and water, such as rainfall, waterfalls, rivers, and seas. Four Dragon Kings each controlled a sea of China: 'East Sea' (the East China Sea), 'South Sea' (the South China Sea), 'West Sea' (Qinghai Lake and lakes beyond), and 'North Sea' (Lake Baikal). The four Dragon Kings were believed to be the dispensers of rain and wind.
        In many Chinese villages, there are still some temples or shrines to worship the Dragon Kings to seek their blessings of good weather for harvests and all year round. In pre-modern times, local people offered sacrifices to appease the Dragon Kings to stop flooding or droughts.</details>
